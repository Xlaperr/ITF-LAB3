                        <h3>Rapunzel</h3>
                        <p>Princess Rapunzel, born with long hair as the result of the power of the sun drop, was kidnapped by Mother Gothel so she could use the power
                         of Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel eventually escapes with Flynn Rider and goes on an adventure that changes her life.
                        Always optimistic and searching for the brighter side of things, Rapunzel does all she can to help her friends and family by showing
                        that nothing can keep her down. Rapunzel is voiced by Mandy Moore, except in the video game Kingdom Hearts III, where she is voiced by Kelsey Lansdowne</p>
